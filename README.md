[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18819431.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18819431)

## 1. Executive Summary
This repository contains the formalization of the **Boghian-Shift Theorem**, a breakthrough in high-energy physics designed to achieve helium-free cryogenic temperatures (2.1K) for Large Circular Colliders (LCC). By utilizing a 1.2 GHz magnetic cascade synchronization, the MARS-3 architecture achieves a theoretical thermal efficiency of 94.5%.
