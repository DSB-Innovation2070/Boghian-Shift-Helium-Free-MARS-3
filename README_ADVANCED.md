MARS 3 - Official Mathematical Foundation
1. The Thermodynamic Goal (Boghian-MARS Displacement)

The fundamental advantage of MARS 3 is the elimination of thermal lag. The net entropy reduction required to reach the Lambda Point is governed by:
ΔSnet​=∫Ti​Tλ​​TCmag​(T,B)​dT−k=1∑n​Φsync​(fGHz​,Δϕk​)

Nomenclature for Mathematicians:

    ΔSnet​: The net change in entropy (Total cooling yield).

    ∫Ti​Tλ​​: Definite integral from initial temperature to the Lambda Point (2.172 K).

    Cmag​: Magnetic heat capacity of the SSG material.

    T: Absolute Temperature in Kelvin.

    ∑k=1n​: Summation of high-frequency pulses per cycle.

    Φsync​: Quantum Gating Efficiency function.

    fGHz​: Operational frequency (1.2 GHz).

    Δϕk​: The phase-shift constant (The Boghian Shift).

2. The Execution Algorithm (Phase-Locked Gating)

To maintain 96% efficiency, the Boghian-Shift algorithm synchronizes magnetic pulses using this high-frequency command:
ϕ(t)=sin(2π⋅f⋅t)

Nomenclature for Mathematicians:

    ϕ(t): Instantaneous phase amplitude as a function of time.

    sin: Sine wave function for smooth atomic spin transitions.

    2π: Circular constant for angular velocity synchronization.

    f: Operating frequency (1.2 billion cycles per second).

    t: Temporal variable in nanoseconds (10−9s).
